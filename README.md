## Process Overview

Minervabot is invoked by GitHub as a webhook whenever an issue is created,
modified, or closed in a repo. When invoked Minervabot duplicates the changes
in the issue in Clickup tasks. This allows Developers to have access to issues
within GitHub, but PO's, Scrum Masters, and team leads can use Clickup to
manage these within the larger scope of the project.

[Minerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva) is the Roman goddess of wisdom,
justice, law, victory, and the sponsor of arts, trade, and strategy. Her domain
includes music, poetry, medicine, wisdom, commerce, weaving, and the crafts. As
the sponsor of trade Minerva is perfect for connecting disparate systems like
GitHub and ClickUp.
